## Nice to know


### ThreadModeler and Inventor.IO


We have also a website running which works against **Inventor.IO**:

[http://threadmodeler.com/](http://threadmodeler.com/ "ThreadModeler")

Unfortunately we *do not* share this source code, but as I can say that code is also based on what we will do in this github repository.


### powerJobs with Inventor.IO and AutoCAD.IO

One of our products called powerJobs has been upgraded to created jobs communicating wiht Inventor.IO and AutoCad.IO

So, for instance it is possible to create a PDF from a dwg (also ipt, iam..) without have installed localy a Inventor or AutoCad. If this is interested for you, do not hestiate to contact us:
